Whether you are looking for a fresh design, better performance, more productivity, or more fun, Windows 11 has something for you. Here are some of the best Windows 11 features that you should check out.

  

### 1\. A New Start Menu

One of the most noticeable changes in Windows 11 is the new Start menu, which is nowÂ centred on the taskbar and has a floating design. The new Start menu is more **streamlined and intuitive, with pinned** and **recommended apps** at the top, and a search bar at the bottom. You can also access your power options, settings, and user account from the Start menu.

  

The new Start menu also offers smart suggestions based on your recent activities, such as documents, photos, and apps. You can also hover over the search icon to see some suggested apps based on your past searches. If you prefer the old Start menu with live tiles, you can switch back to it by right-clicking on the taskbar and choosing Taskbar settings.

  

### **2\. A New Action Center**

Another major improvement in Windows 11 is the new Action Center, which combines your notifications and quick settings in one place. You can access the Action Center by clicking on the unified icon for WiFi, volume, and battery on the right side of the taskbar. The Action Center has a sleek design with rounded corners and pastel colours, and it offers easy access to important controls such as brightness, volume, Bluetooth, aeroplane  
mode, focus assist, and more.

  

The Action Center also shows your notifications in a clean and organized way, with badges and icons for different apps. You can also reply to messages or clear notifications from the Action Center. The new Action Center is more responsive and user-friendly than the old one in Windows 10.

  

### 3\. Integrated Android Apps

One of the most exciting features of Windows 11 is the integration of Android apps via the Amazon App Store. You can download and run Android apps on your Windows 11 PC, just like you would on your phone or tablet. You can access the Amazon App Store from the updated Microsoft Store, which has a new look and feel and offers more content and choices.

  

You will be able to use Android apps in different ways on Windows 11, such as pinning them to the taskbar or Start menu, snapping them to different parts of the screen, or using them in portrait or landscape mode. You will also be able to use your mouse, keyboard, touchpad, or touchscreen to interact with Android apps on Windows 11.

  

### 4\. Auto-HDR and DirectStorage

If you are a gamer, you will love the new features that Windows 11 brings to enhance your gaming experience. One of them is Auto-HDR, which **automatically adds high dynamic range (HDR)** to games that support it. HDR makes games look more realistic and immersive by enhancing the contrast and colours of the images. Auto-HDR works with over 1000 games on Windows 11, including older titles that were not originally designed for HDR.

Another feature that Windows 11 offers for gamers is DirectStorage, which allows faster loading times for games that have large assets. DirectStorage bypasses unnecessary steps and delivers data directly from your SSD to your GPU. This reduces CPU load and latency and allows you to enjoy larger and more detailed game worlds without waiting.

  

  

These are just some of the best Windows 11 features that you should try out when you upgrade to the new operating system. Windows 11 also offers other features such as Snap Layouts and Snap Groups for better multitasking, Widgets for personalized information at a glance, Microsoft Teams integration for easier communication and collaboration, and much more. Windows 11 is designed to make your PC experience more personal, productive, and fun.
