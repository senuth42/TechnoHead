Have you ever wished you could access the power of artificial intelligence (AI) without being glued to your phone screen? Do you want to enjoy the benefits of personal computing while staying present in your surroundings? If so, you might be interested in the Humane Ai Pin, a new wearable device that aims to revolutionize the way we interact with technology.

## What is the Humane Ai Pin?

The Humane Ai Pin is a small, white square that you can pin to your shirt or lapel. It has a camera, speaker, and microphone, but no screen. Instead, it uses a laser display that can project a minimal interface onto your hand or a wall, if needed. But the main way you communicate with the device is through voice commands and gestures.

The Humane Ai Pin is powered by a software platform that harnesses the power of AI to enable innovative personal computing experiences. It can connect to various AI services, such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4, to perform tasks such as calling a friend, translating a conversation, taking photos, reminding you of something, or answering a question. The device can also sense your context and provide relevant information or suggestions based on your location, time, activity, and preferences.

The Humane Ai Pin is designed to be a standalone device that does not require a smartphone or a cloud connection to function. It has its own cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity, as well as built-in storage and battery. The device retails for $699, plus a $24 per month subscription fee that covers the AI services and updates.

## Who is behind the Humane Ai Pin?

The Humane Ai Pin is the first product of Humane, a San Francisco-based company founded by two former Apple executives, [Imran Chaudhri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Chaudhri) and [Bethany Bongiorno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Inc.). They were part of the team that helped design the iPhone, iPad, and other Apple products. They left Apple in 2017 to start Humane, with a vision of creating a new kind of device that would leverage AI to enhance human capabilities and creativity.

Humane has raised over $100 million in funding from investors such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Salesforce co-CEOs Marc and Lynne Benioff, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. The company has also hired some of the best talent in the industry, including Ken Kocienda, the former Apple engineer who created the iPhone keyboard and autocorrect.

Humane has been working on the Humane Ai Pin for over four years, in a secretive and stealthy manner. The company revealed the name of the device in June 2023 and officially launched it in November 2023, at a TED talk and a press event.

## Why is the Humane Ai Pin different from other wearable devices?

The Humane Ai Pin is different from other wearable devices in several ways. First, it is a screenless device that does not rely on visual cues or notifications to capture your attention. Instead, it uses voice and gestures as the primary modes of interaction, allowing you to stay focused on the real world and the people around you.

Second, it is an AI-powered device that can access and process large amounts of data and natural language, providing intelligent and personalized responses and recommendations. It can also learn from your behavior and preferences, adapting to your needs and goals.

Third, it is a standalone device that does not depend on a smartphone or a cloud connection to work. It has its connectivity, storage, and battery, operating independently or in sync with other devices. It also respects your privacy and security, not sharing your data with third parties without your consent.

## How can the Humane Ai Pin improve your life?

The Humane Ai Pin can improve your life in many ways, depending on how you use it. Here are some examples of what you can do with the device:

- Use it as a personal assistant for tasks such as scheduling appointments, booking travel, ordering food, or setting reminders.
- Communicate with friends and family through voice and video calls, with the added ability to translate languages in real-time.
- Capture moments and memories with the built-in camera, which uses AI to take high-quality photos and videos.
- Get information and recommendations based on your context, whether you're in a new city, trying a new activity, or exploring a new topic.
- Enhance your creativity with AI-powered tools for writing, drawing, and brainstorming.

The possibilities are vast, and as developers create new applications and integrations, the capabilities of the Humane Ai Pin will continue to expand.

## Conclusion

The Humane Ai Pin represents a bold step towards a future where AI is seamlessly integrated into our lives in a way that enhances our human experience. It challenges the current paradigm of screen-centric devices and opens up new possibilities for interaction and creativity. Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a creative professional, or someone looking for a smarter way to navigate the digital world, the Humane Ai Pin is worth exploring.
